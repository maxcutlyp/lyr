# lyr
Query songs &amp; lyrics using the command line

## Setup
- Build or install using `go build` or `go install` respectively
- Set your genius api key using `lyr token <key>`. Get your free api key [here](https://docs.genius.com/).

## Usage
- Perform search requests using `lyr query <song name or lyrics excerpt>` or the aliases `get`, `find` or `search` 
- Pick one of the options from the resulting songs and fetch its lyrics
- Optionally provide a pager (like `less`) with `lyr query -p less <song name or lyrics excerpt>`

This could be improved and extended upon quite a lot, but for now it gets the job done I suppose
